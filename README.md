# HPVCancerOntology (HPVCO)

The HPVCancerOntology (HPVCO) aims to provide a structured and patient-centric representation of knowledge surrounding HPV-related cancers, their associated risk factors, prevention strategies, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and psychosocial impacts. 
This ontology incorporates concepts relevant to both healthcare providers and patients, ensuring that the modeled knowledge is comprehensive and accessible. 

HPVCO leverages competency questions framed from a patient perspective to guide domain coverage, aiming to capture essential patient concerns and queries. 
The ontology also integrates standard biomedical terminologies such as NCIT, enhancing interoperability and enabling linkage to established knowledge bases. 

By focusing on the validity of logical axioms and aligning with patient-oriented frameworks, HPVCO supports educational, diagnostic, and decision-support tools, particularly for health consumers navigating HPV-related health challenges.
